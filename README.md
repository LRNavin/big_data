# big_data
 In this lab we will put the concepts that are central to Supercomputing with Big Data in some practical context. We will analyze a large open data set and identify a way of processing it efficiently using Apache Spark and the Ama- zon Web Services (AWS). The data set in question is the GDELT 2.0 Global Knowledge Graph (GKG), which indexes persons, organizations, companies, locations, themes, and even emotions from live news reports in print, broad- cast and internet sources all over the world. We will use this data to construct a histogram of the topics that are most popular on a given day, hopefully giving us some interesting insights into the most important themes in recent history.
